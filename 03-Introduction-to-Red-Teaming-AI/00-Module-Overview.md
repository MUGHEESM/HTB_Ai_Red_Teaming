# Module Overview: Introduction to Red Teaming AI

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to the world of red teaming Artificial Intelligence (AI) and systems utilizing Machine Learning (ML) deployments. It covers an overview of common security vulnerabilities in these systems and the types of attacks that can be launched against their components.

## Module Summary

For penetration testers to assess the security of systems utilizing Machine Learning (ML) deployments, it is crucial to gain a deep understanding of the types of security vulnerabilities that may arise within them, how ML systems interact with traditional systems, and how these interactions may result in security issues. This module provides a broad introduction to security assessments of ML-based systems and generative AI.

In more detail, this module covers the following:

- ML OWASP Top 10
- LLM OWASP Top 10
- Attacking ML-based systems and their components

This module is broken into sections with accompanying hands-on exercises to practice each of the tactics and techniques we cover. The module ends with a practical hands-on skills assessment to gauge your understanding of the various topic areas.

You can start and stop the module at any time and pick up where you left off. There is no time limit or "grading", but you must complete all of the exercises and the skills assessment to receive the maximum number of cubes and have this module marked as complete in any paths you have chosen.
