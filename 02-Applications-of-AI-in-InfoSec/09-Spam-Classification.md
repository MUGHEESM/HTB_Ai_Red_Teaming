# Spam Classification

Spam, or unsolicited bulk messaging, has been a persistent issue since the early days of digital communication. It clutters inboxes, poses security risks, and can be used for malicious purposes such as phishing attacks. Effective spam detection is crucial for maintaining the integrity and usability of email systems and other messaging platforms.

## Naive Bayes for Spam Detection

Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Mathematically, it is expressed as:

```python
P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)
```

Where:

- **P(A|B)** is the probability of event A occurring, given that B is true.
- **P(B|A)** is the probability of event B occurring, given that A is true.
- **P(A)** is the prior probability of event A.
- **P(B)** is the prior probability of event B.

In the context of spam detection, A can represent the hypothesis that an email is spam (Spam), and B can represent the observed features of the email (e.g., words, phrases, etc.).

### Applying Bayes' Theorem to Spam Detection

Let's break down how Bayes' Theorem can be applied to determine if an email is spam:

1. **Hypothesis:** We want to determine the probability that an email is spam given its features.
   - **P(Spam|Features):** Probability that an email is spam given its features.

2. **Likelihood:** This is the probability of observing the features given that the email is spam.
   - **P(Features|Spam):** Probability of the features appearing in a spam email.

3. **Prior Probability:** The probability that any email is spam, irrespective of its features.
   - **P(Spam):** Prior probability of an email being spam.

4. **Marginal Likelihood:** The total probability of observing the features, considering both spam and non-spam emails.
   - **P(Features):** Probability of the features appearing in any email.

Using Bayes' Theorem, we can express this as:

```python
P(Spam|Features) = (P(Features|Spam) * P(Spam)) / P(Features)
```

### Simplifying with Naive Assumptions

Naive Bayes makes the "naive" assumption that the presence of a particular feature in an email is independent of the presence of any other feature, given the class label. This simplifies the calculation of P(Features|Spam):

```python
P(Features|Spam) = P(feature1|Spam) * P(feature2|Spam) * ... * P(featureN|Spam)
```

Similarly, for non-spam emails:

```python
P(Features|Not Spam) = P(feature1|Not Spam) * P(feature2|Not Spam) * ... * P(featureN|Not Spam)
```

Using these probabilities, we can calculate the posterior probability of an email being spam or not spam given its features. The class with the higher posterior probability is chosen as the predicted class.

### Example Calculation

Suppose we have an email with features F1 and F2. We want to determine if this email is spam.

- **P(Spam) = 0.3:** Prior probability that any email is spam.
- **P(Not Spam) = 0.7:** Prior probability that any email is not spam.
- **P(F1|Spam) = 0.4:** Probability of feature F1 given the email is spam.
- **P(F2|Spam) = 0.5:** Probability of feature F2 given the email is spam.
- **P(F1|Not Spam) = 0.2:** Probability of feature F1 given the email is not spam.
- **P(F2|Not Spam) = 0.3:** Probability of feature F2 given the email is not spam.

Using the Naive Bayes assumption:

```python
P(F1, F2|Spam) = P(F1|Spam) * P(F2|Spam) = 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2
P(F1, F2|Not Spam) = P(F1|Not Spam) * P(F2|Not Spam) = 0.2 * 0.3 = 0.06
```

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

```python
P(Spam|F1, F2) = (P(F1, F2|Spam) * P(Spam)) / P(F1, F2)
```

To find P(F1, F2), we use the law of total probability:

```python
P(F1, F2) = P(F1, F2|Spam) * P(Spam) + P(F1, F2|Not Spam) * P(Not Spam)
          = (0.2 * 0.3) + (0.06 * 0.7)
          = 0.06 + 0.042
          = 0.102
```

Thus:

```python
P(Spam|F1, F2) = (0.2 * 0.3) / 0.102
               = 0.06 / 0.102
               ≈ 0.588
```

Similarly:

```python
P(Not Spam|F1, F2) = (P(F1, F2|Not Spam) * P(Not Spam)) / P(F1, F2)
                   = (0.06 * 0.7) / 0.102
                   = 0.042 / 0.102
                   ≈ 0.412
```

Since P(Spam|F1, F2) > P(Not Spam|F1, F2), the email is classified as spam.
