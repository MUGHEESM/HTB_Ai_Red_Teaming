# Applications of AI in InfoSec

## Introduction

Following the Fundamentals of AI module, this module takes a more practical approach to applying machine learning techniques. Instead of focusing solely on theory, you will now engage in hands-on activities that involve building and evaluating real models. Throughout this process, you will gain experience with the end-to-end workflow of AI development, from exploring datasets to training and testing models.

You will construct three distinct AI models in this module:

- A **Spam Classifier** to determine whether an SMS message is spam or not.
- A **Network Anomaly Detection Model** designed to identify abnormal or potentially malicious network traffic.
- A **Malware Classifier** using byteplots, which are visual representations of binary data.

Throughout the module, you will encounter python code blocks that guide you step-by-step through the model-building process.

You will learn more about Jupyter later in this module, but for now, understand that you can copy and paste these code snippets into a Jupyter notebook to execute them in sequence, either in the playground VM, or your environment.

You can train most of these models in your own environment. For a decent experience, you will need at least 4GB of RAM and at least 4 CPU cores.

**Note:** Throughout this module, all sections marked as interactive contain code blocks for you to follow along. Not all interactive sections contain separate exercises.
